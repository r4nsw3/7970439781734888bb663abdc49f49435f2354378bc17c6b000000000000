  |   There's trouble once again on the mean streets of River City, but     |
  |   this time the boys are in over their heads! In this all-new entry     |
  |   in the legendary beat-'em-up series, hot-blooded heroes Kunio and     |
  |   Riki have been captured, leaving it to their hard-hitting             |
  |   girlfriends, Kyoko and Misako, to serve up some payback. As you       |
  |   punch and kick your way across town - either solo or with a friend    |
  |   in local co-op - you'll gain new skills, chow down on power-ups,      |
  |   wield an assortment of weapons, and unleash an arsenal of combos,     |
  |   throws, and special attacks that will leave the bad guys crying for   |
  |   mama - all in outrageous 16-bit style! The awesome action is          |
  |   punctuated by manga story panels, anime cutscenes, and an epic        |
  |   synth-pop soundtrack. It's an old-school rumble for a new             |
  |   generation!                                                           |
